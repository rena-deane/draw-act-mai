# Act Mai, Draw Mai

AMDM is a personal project that I worked on before I started bootcamp.

## Learnings
- [ ] HTML/CSS
- [ ] Vanilla Javascript
- [ ] Asking for help from teachers
- [ ] Screencast explaining our project

## Next Steps

I started refactoring the code and do look forward to developing the game [Act-Mai-Draw-Mai](https://github.com/rena-deane/act-mai-draw-mai)
